## Handle Missing Values

### Drop rows or columns: 
This involves simply removing rows or columns that contain missing values

This can be useful if the number of missing values is small, but 
it can also lead to the loss of important data if the number of missing values is large

### Impute missing values: 
This involves replacing the missing values with a substitute value, such as the mean, median, or mode of 
the non-missing values

This can be done using the SimpleImputer class from the sklearn.impute library:
```
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Create the SimpleImputer object
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")

# Fit the SimpleImputer object to the data
imputer.fit(X)

# Transform the data
X_imputed = imputer.transform(X)
```

This code creates a SimpleImputer object that replaces missing values with the mean of the non-missing values 

It fits the imputer to the data X and then uses the transform method to impute the missing values

The resulting data with imputed values is stored in X_imputed

### Use a different model: 
Some machine learning algorithms are able to handle missing values internally, 
such as decision trees and random forests

In these cases, you can simply pass the data with missing values to the model and 
it will handle the missing values internally
